## Project Consolidation (February 26, 2025)

The project has been successfully consolidated by merging the `template-2` directory into the root project. The following actions were taken:

1. **Files Copied**:
   - Configuration files like `next.config.mjs`, `next-env.d.ts`
   - Documentation files and the `paths` directory
   - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

2. **Directory Structure**:
   - The `src` directory now contains all application code
   - Quiz pages and components have been properly set up
   - Original source code backed up in the `backup` directory

3. **Cleanup**:
   - Created a cleanup script (`cleanup.ps1`) to remove temporary files when the development server is not running
   - Removed the `src.old` backup directory

The project is now in a consistent state with all necessary files and directory structure in place. The application should be fully functional with all features from both directories properly merged.

**Note**: To complete the cleanup, run the `cleanup.ps1` script when the development server is not running to remove the `template-2` directory.
